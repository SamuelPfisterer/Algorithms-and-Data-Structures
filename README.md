# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from the 'Algorithms and Data Structures' class at ETH Zurich. I scored full points for all the solutions. This selection includes rather difficult problems and covers topics like dynamic programming, tree datastructures and graph theory.
